## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JSON (local data.json file)
- Sass
- TypeScript
- Webpack

### What I learned

1. TypeScript
    - typing function parameters and return value
    - interface
2. SCSS
    - variables
    - nesting
    - partials
    - modules
    - @use & @import
3. Webpack
    - basic configuration
      - entry points
      - output
      - loaders
      - plugins
      - mode
      - 3rd party plugins: nodemon

### Continued development

- This is my first attempt to try using TypeScript along with SCSS and Webpack.
For styling, as main part of this challenge, I was able to put some knowledge of CSS Grid layout into practice, though need to hone my styling and layout skills further.
